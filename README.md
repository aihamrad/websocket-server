- This code is a simple implementation of a WebSocket server using the WebSocket module. The server listens for incoming connections on 0.0.0.0 at port 13000.

- Upon receiving a new connection, the server logs a message indicating the new connection and sends a message to the client. The server then sets up event listeners to log messages received from the client, errors that occur, and when the connection is closed.

- When a message is received from the client, the server sends a message back to the client acknowledging the received message and sends a random message generated using the random-words module.
